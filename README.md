# Learning JavaScript Web APIs

A personal project documenting my journey to learn and understand the various Web APIs available in modern browsers. Each directory represents a different Web API where I'll explore functionality, implementation examples, and best practices.

## Purpose

This repository tracks my personal learning journey to:

- Explore the extensive collection of Web APIs available in JavaScript
- Build practical examples for each API
- Document usage patterns and browser compatibility
- Develop a deeper understanding of browser capabilities
- Create a personal reference for future web development projects

The primary goal is to expand my knowledge of what's possible in the browser and gain hands-on experience with APIs I might not use regularly.

## Web APIs Included

## Progress Tracking

For each API, I'll track my progress:

1. â¬œ Not Started
2. ðŸ”„ In Progress
3. âœ… Completed Basic Understanding
4. ðŸŒŸ Advanced Implementation

## Motivation

This project helps me:

- Systematically explore the vast array of browser capabilities
- Build a personal reference for future web development
- Create practical examples I can reuse in real projects
- Understand the strengths and limitations of each API
- Stay current with evolving web standards

## Personal Notes

This repository is primarily for my personal learning journey. While others might find some of these examples helpful, they reflect my own learning process and aren't intended as comprehensive tutorials.
